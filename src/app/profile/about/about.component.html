                        I am passionate about software engineering and finding creative 
                        solutions to solve complex problems. 
                        After several years as a clinical researcher and a medical interpreter, 
                        I have found myself drawn to the world of programming, its fast pace and unlimited learning opportunities. 
                        Trained in JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, Node, and AWS.
